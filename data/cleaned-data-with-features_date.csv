0,Tim McGraw,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin back on all of that its nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read is

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday youll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress

With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a onehand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says Baby is something wrong
I say Nothing
I was just thinking
How we dont have a song
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her and I should have
And when I got home  fore I said Amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice
All the roses
And the note that said

22,Forever & Always (Piano Version),"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up

Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer

I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything tell me why you couldnt see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles

And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
I say Theres nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it I mean it

I said Leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you

And dont you leave cause I know

With your face and the beautiful eyes

And the faded picture of a beautiful night

And youre dancing round your room when the night ends

And your first kiss makes your head spin round

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

I should have known I should have known

That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell

Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naïve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance

You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings

Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down

Begging for forgiveness begging for me
Just like I always wanted but Im so sorry

Cause Im not your princess this aint a fairy tale
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town

You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Flash forward and were taking on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

And I remember that fight
Twothirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the Goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone

Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while

Youve been good busier than ever
We smalltalk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call

And I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was Goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right

Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night

When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why

Dont you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism
To blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And youll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who dont understand
And I look back in regret
How I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can

And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests

Have tired lifeless eyes
Cause youve burned them out

Before fire could catch me

Forcing laughter faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered Have we met
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM who do you love
I wonder til Im wide awake
And now Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon

Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

I never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

Shes not a saint

Shes an actress

For the things that she does on the mattress

On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind

There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her everpresent frown is a little troubling
She thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Think about what you did

Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party youre showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
Im not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How youd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions

And Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And its a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the sidelines wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming This is absurd
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In rippedup jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Im not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment
Promise me this
That youll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know its long gone
And that magics not here no more
And I might be okay
But Im not fine at all

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on a teeball team
You tell me bout your past thinking your future was me

And I know its long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah

Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known

Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet and said Okay lets talk

And I said
Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

Before you Id only dated selfindulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughin
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay stay stay

66,Holy Ground,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
Back to a firstglance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light Go
Hey you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

Now its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that youre lucky
But youre so confused
Cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights You wonder if youll make it out alive

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing

Picked me up late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy running wild wild
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

Just waiting for you to walk in

As I comb back through my memory

Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
As Im looking around the room

And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by

But your close friends always seem to know
When theres something really wrong

4 AM the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself Dont get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in London today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

New York be here
But youre in London and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around

So I punched a hole in the roof Ohoh ohoh

Of your fears and your ghosts

We wait for trains that just arent coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better

Were so young but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
Its poker he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace

We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

Is this small town
You said it was a great love one for the ages

Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand

Our songs films united stand
Our country guess lawless land
Quiet fears touch hand
Paper cut stings paperthin plans

126,the last great american dynasty,"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said How did a middleclass divorcée do it

The wedding was charming if a little gauche
Theres only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up what couldve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up what couldve been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits and then it was bought by me

Who knows if I never showed up what couldve been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen

Would you tell me to go fuck myself

Love slipped beyond reaches
And I couldnt give reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch Chevy door
November flush flannel cure
This dorm madhouse
I made joke Well made me
How evergreen group friends
Dont think well say word again
And soon theyll nerve deck halls
That walked through
One money two show
I never ready I watch go
Sometimes dont know answer
Til someones knees asks you
She wouldve made lovely bride
What shame shes fucked head said
But youll find real thing instead
Shell patch tapestry I shred

And hold hand dancing
Never leave standing
Crestfallen landing
With champagne problems
Your moms ring pocket
Her picture wallet
You wont remember my
Champagne problems

You wont remember my

And in the disbelief I cant face reinvention

But there was happiness because of you

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes

Begin to look like a smirk
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons

And I pulled your body into mine

And you know you hurt him too

But I didnt know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

To a boy who changed his mind

160,Love Story (Taylor's Version),"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess

Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say Yes

And never really had a chance

Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

169,The Best Day (Taylor's Version),"Im five years old its getting cold Ive got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

Im thirteen now
And dont know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names

I dont know who Im going to talk to now at school
But I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother inside and out
Hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew so Im taking this chance to say

178,You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"Taylor Swift
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldnt I find a stain but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know you can scratch it right off
Its how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket its been spent and traded in
You cant change where its been
Reminds me of me

I lived and I learned
Had you got burned
Held out and held on
God knows too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that Id get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your Dont you wish you had me grin
Well I did so I smiled and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived and I learned
Had you got burned
Held out and held on

And wasted time lost tears
Swore that Id get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me

I lived and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die

When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby it was good baby
We showed em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Without me without me without me

And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now

188,All Too Well (Taylor's Version),"I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition
And my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and that magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all ohohoh

Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
And I know its long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well

While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a firstglance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling it was good

And right there where we stood

196,The Lucky One (Taylor's Version),"New to town with a made up name
In the angels city chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one
Oh oh oh

Now its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky but youre so confused
Cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one
Oh oh oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window we were seventeen and crazy running wild wild
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said Oh my what a marvelous tune

Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way

He didnt like it when I wore high heels but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song but I do I do

I walked in expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

Had as many James Taylor records as you but I do

Shouldve burst through the door
With that Baby Im right here smile
And it wouldve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I wouldve been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
Ive got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how Ive been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said youd be here
You said youd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
As Im looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When theres something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly

And asking me about you

Pierce the room like a cannonball

I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming Why
Flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And its about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray well just disappear
Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you
And what if I kept the handmedowns you wont grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Were going to fly away from here

Were going to fly away from here

You fought hard like army guy
Remember I leaned whispered you

Come baby me
Were going fly away here
You best four years

I remember drive home
When blind hope turned crying screaming Why
Flowers pile worst way one knows say
About beautiful boy died
And Halloween
You could anything wanted still here
I remember last day I kissed face
And whispered ear

Come baby me
Were going fly away here
Out curtained room hospital gray well disappear
Come baby me
Were going fly away here

And I kept handmedowns wont grow into
And I really thought miracle would see us through
What miracle even getting one moment you

Than lovin a man who didnt know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasnt 4AM standing in the mirror
Saying to myself You know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy oh I can hear it now
Talking down to me like Id always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh you never thought Id run

But nothing at twentytwo
And will you still want me when Im nothing new

How long will it be cute all this crying in my room
When you cant blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room

When you realized Im harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm no it wasnt a mansion
Just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say you cant help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in you said were too different
You laughed at my dreams rolled your eyes at my jokes

I dont have to be your shrink to know that youll never be happy

Does it make you feel sad
That the love that youre lookin for
Is the love that you had

Now youre out in the world searchin for your soul
Scared not to be hip scared to get old
Chasing makebelieve status last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me

That it turned out Im harder to forget than I was to leave

213,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all
Oh oh oh

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the teeball team
You taught me bout your past thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy
Key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down any time now
Hes gonna say its love you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well yeah

Well maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all

They say alls well that ends well but Im in a new Hell
Every time you doublecross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me who was she
A neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened you
Thats what happened you
You who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes
Sipping coffee like youre on a latenight show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
And he said Its supposed to be fun turning twentyone

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known

It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
Ill get older but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us did the love affair maim you too
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us do you remember it all too well
Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there

And how the blood rushed into my cheeks so scarlet it was

The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon

Were shaking blind and hazy

I should not be left to my own devices

Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming

Cause you got tired of my scheming

And Im a monster on the hill

Pierced through the heart but never killed

Im unglued thanks to you

I searched aurora borealis green
Ive never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery

And to hide that would be so dishonest
And its fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till its true

I wait patiently hes gonna notice me
Its okay were the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice youre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if its your face
I didnt choose this town I dream of getting out
Theres just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

Youre on your own kid
You always have been

I see the great escape so long Daisy May
I picked the petals he loves me not
Something different bloomed writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
Ill run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams arent rare

Youre on your own kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood sweat and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like Id be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny I took the money
My friends from home dont know what to say
I looked around in a bloodsoaked gown
And I saw something they cant take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets take the moment and taste it
Youve got no reason to be afraid

Youre on your own kid
Yeah you can face this

I waited ages see there
I search party better bodies
Just learn never cared

I see great escape long Daisy May
I picked petals loves not
Something different bloomed writing room
I play songs parking lot
Ill run away

I called taxi take there
I search party better bodies
Just learn dreams arent rare

Youre kid

From sprinkler splashes fireplace ashes
I gave blood sweat tears this
I hosted parties starved body
Like Id saved perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny I took money
My friends home dont know say
I looked around bloodsoaked gown
And I saw something cant take away
Cause pages turned bridges burned
Everything lose step take
So make friendship bracelets take moment taste it
Youve got reason afraid

Youre kid
Yeah face this

Tiny as a firefly a pebble
That we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes
Ooh ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyones up to something
I found myself arunning home to your sweet nothings

Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember uhhuh
Tears on the letter I vowed
Not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe its the past thats talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember uhhuh
The burning embers I vowed
Not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uhhuh uhhuh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze
Got a sense Id been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue
So I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought Id lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair
Theres no morning glory
It was war it wasnt fair
And we will never go back to that

Bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for

244,All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version),"I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singin in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all
Oh oh oh

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the teeball team
You taught me bout your past thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground we were always skippin town
And I was thinkin on the drive down Any time now
Hes gonna say its love you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well ohohohoh

And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Runnin scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein honest
Im a crumpledup piece of paper lyin here
Cause I remember it all all all

They say alls well that ends well but Im in a new hell
Every time you doublecross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it wouldve been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me who was she
A neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin in a party bathroom
Some actress askin me what happened you
Thats what happened you
You who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre on a latenight show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night willin you to come
And he said Its supposed to be fun turning twentyone

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still tryin to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah

Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin jokes but the punch line goes
Ill get older but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us did the love affair maim you too
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us do you remember it all too well
Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well
Just between us I remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there I was there

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time

Its me hi

At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

Always rooting for the antihero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is an art bro lately
And I just judge them on the hill
Too hurt to hang out talking shit about your famous baby
Pierced through the heart of 90s guilt
Maybe Im the problem its me

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman
Taylor youll be fine
I wake up screaming from dreaming

Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

I wish it wasnt 4am standing in the mirror
Saying to myself you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again

And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy oh I can hear it now
Youre talking down to me like Ill always be around
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun

It starts with a smile and we walk a few miles

Youre better off 
youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl that boy is trouble

Somehow it feels like were flying
Dont wanna come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause youre gone

In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thats good enough for me
Dont need the real thing
Thats just another thing
For me to try to tame
Dont know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go

A perfect little dream inside my head

Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Oh oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Maybe Im wrong but I dont think Romeo would be my kind of guy

And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they havent thought of yet

Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
Ill wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
Its what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I dont regret it cause it needs to be perfect

Sorry for the inconvenience I didnt mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but its too bad you didnt see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

Lets talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled well the cameras in your mind
And I lied I swore that everything was fine

They are the reason the shows are incredible
And I know those fans out there are just all in

Were all bored were all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just arent coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better

Were so young but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
Its poker he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace

We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming Why
Flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And its about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey well just disappear

Laying in the green grass I was watching clouds pass

Cold barns truck beds everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And thats what I learned from you

Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh your ghost your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But Im a little smarter my hearts a little harder
But its still soft enough to cry

Off into the night

Theyll just keep on shining bright

Cant call it love if you aint in it

With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Its so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go cause he dont know
But the writings on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I dont know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall so baby

361,We Were Happy,"We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

On the boats in the water

Your shiny boots and your full on band
A smile on your face a knife in your hand
Singing songs youve got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But dont worry yourself I aint your competition
But dont flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I aint
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
Lets talk about me and you in an empty room and who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Lets talk about what you wanna be and who Ive always been

The same guitar Ive always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd youre paying dues
I tell them This is what I do
And its what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
Oh but the easy ride was never my ambition

In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need
Id give everything to be your anything

370,Your Face,"I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face
In every space
Every room

And I know if I turn around you wont be there
If I close my eyes will you be there

I dont wanna lose your face
And I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont wanna turn around
Cause Im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

Ive got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call

And now I wonder to myself
Who were you Where are you
Were you ever here at all

I dont wanna lose your face
And I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont wanna turn around
Cause Im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

I dont wanna lose your face
I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont wanna turn around
Cause Im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

I dont wanna lose your face
I dont wanna turn around
