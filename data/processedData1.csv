0,Tim McGraw,"He said way blue eyes shined
Put Georgia stars shame night
I said Thats lie
Just boy Chevy truck
That tendency gettin stuck
On back roads night
And I right beside summer long
And time woke find summer gone

But think Tim McGraw
I hope think favorite song
The one danced night long
The moon like spotlight lake
When think happiness
I hope think little black dress
Think head chest
And old faded blue jeans
When think Tim McGraw
I hope think me

September saw month tears
And thankin God werent here
To see like that
But box beneath bed
Is letter never read
From three summers back
Its hard find little bittersweet
And lookin back nice believe

When think Tim McGraw
I hope think favorite song
The one danced night long
The moon like spotlight lake
When think happiness
I hope think little black dress
Think head chest
And old faded blue jeans
When think Tim McGraw
I hope think me

And Im back first time since then
Im standin street
And theres letter left doorstep
And first thing youll read is

When think Tim McGraw
I hope think favorite song
Someday youll turn radio on
I hope takes back place

When think happiness
I hope think little black dress
Think head chest
And old faded blue jeans
When think Tim McGraw
I hope think me

Oh think me
Mmmm

43,Dear John,"Long nights
When days revolved around you
Counting footsteps
Praying floor wont fall through
Again

And mother accused losing mind
But I swore I fine

You paint blue sky
And go back turn rain
And I lived chess game
But changed rules every day

Wonderin version I might get phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin song let know why

Dear John
I see youre gone
Dont think I young messed
With
The girl dress
Cried whole way home
I shouldve known

Well maybe me
And blind optimism
To blame
Or maybe sick need
To give love take away

And youll add name
To long list traitors
Who dont understand
And I look back regret
How I ignored said
Run fast can

Dear John
I see youre gone
Dont think I young messed
With
The girl dress
Cried whole way home

Dear John
I see It wrong
Dont think nineteens young played
By dark twisted games
When I loved so
I shouldve known

You expert Sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed acing tests
All girls youve run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
Cause youve burned out

But I took matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over sad empty town

Dear John
I see youre gone
Dont think I young messed
With
The girl dress
Cried whole way home

I see youre gone
Dont think I young messed
With
The girl dress

You traded baseball cap crown
When gave us trophies
And held town

And cynics outraged
Screaming This absurd
Cause moment band thieves
In rippedup jeans got rule world

And bring pretenders

Confetti falls ground

That youll stand forever
But God forbid fate step in

And force us goodbye

And magics more
And I might okay
But Im fine all

Cause little town street
You almost ran red cause looking me
Wind hair I I remember well

Photo album counter cheeks turning red
You used little kid glasses twinsized bed
And mothers telling stories bout teeball team
You tell bout past thinking future me

And I know long gone
And nothing else I could do
And I forget long enough
To forget I needed to

Cause middle night
Were dancing round kitchen refrigerator light
Down stairs I I remember well yeah

Maybe got lost translation maybe I asked much
But maybe thing masterpiece til tore up
Running scared I I remember well

And call break like promise
So casually cruel name honest
Im crumpled piece paper lying here
Cause I remember well

After plaid shirt days nights made own
Now mail back things I walk home alone

But keep old scarf first week

Cause I loved so
Back lost one real thing youve ever known
It rare I I remember well

And youd come back

Filled pool champagne swam big names
And blew money boys ballet
And losing card game bets Dalí

Pacing rocks staring midnight sea

Up room slates clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes

So never saint
And Ive loved shades wrong
We learn live pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But love brave wild

Saw comin
And Ill never
Be same

This state grace
This worthwhile fight
Love ruthless game
Unless play good right
These hands fate
Youre Achilles heel
This golden age something good right real

And I never
Saw comin
And Ill never
Be oh

Oh I never
Saw comin
And Ill never
Be same

Race cars kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
I love moon back
I remember blue eyes looking mine
Like secret club
I remember dancing bed time
Then jumping waking up
I still feel hold hand little man
And even moment I knew
You fought hard like army guy
Remember I leaned whispered you

Come baby me
Were going fly away here
You best four years

I remember drive home
When blind hope turned crying screaming Why
Flowers pile worst way one knows say
About beautiful boy died
And Halloween
You could anything wanted still here
I remember last day I kissed face
And whispered ear

Come baby me
Were going fly away here
Out curtained room hospital gray well disappear
Come baby me
Were going fly away here
You best four years

What Im standing closet trying talk you
And I kept handmedowns wont grow into
And I really thought miracle would see us through
What miracle even getting one moment you

Come baby me
Were going fly away here

Were going fly away here

Spineless tomb silence
Tore banners down
Took battle underground

Maybe her
Flashes battle come back blur

Uhhuh sweet dream over
My hand one reached for
All throughout Great War
Always remember uhhuh
Tears letter I vowed
Not cry anymore
If survived Great War

You drew good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank poison alone
You said I trust freely
But diesel desire
You playing fire
And maybe past thats talking
Screaming crypt
Telling punish things never did
So I justified it

All bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh bombs closer
My hand one reached for
All throughout Great War
Always remember uhhuh
The burning embers I vowed
Not fight anymore
If survived Great War
Uhhuh uhhuh

It turned something bigger
Somewhere haze
Got sense Id betrayed
Your finger hairpin triggers
Soldier icy ground
Looked honor truth
Broken blue
So I called troops
That night I nearly lost you
I really thought Id lost you

We plant memory garden
Say solemn prayer
Place poppy hair
Theres morning glory
It war wasnt fair
And never go back that

Bloodshed crimson clover

My hand one reached for

Always remember uhhuh
Were burned better I vowed
I would always yours

Oh sweet disposition wideeyed gaze
Were singin car getting lost upstate

And I picture days

And I know long gone and
That magics more
And I might okay Im fine all
Oh oh oh

Cause little town street
You almost ran red cause lookin me
Wind hair I there
I remember well

Photo album counter cheeks turnin red
You used little kid glasses twinsized bed
And mothers tellin stories bout teeball team
You taught bout past thinkin future me
And tossing car keys Fuck patriarchy
Keychain ground always skippin town
And I thinkin drive Any time now
Hes gonna say love never called was
Til dead gone buried
Check pulse come back swearin same
After three months grave
And wondered went I reached you
But I felt shame held lifeless frame

And I know long gone and
There nothing else I could do
And I forget long enough
To forget I needed to

Cause middle night
Were dancin round kitchen refrigerator light
Down stairs I there
I remember well
And nobody know
You kept like secret I kept like oath
Sacred prayer wed swear
To remember well ohohohoh

And maybe got lost translation maybe I asked much
Maybe thing masterpiece til tore up
Runnin scared I there
I remember well
And call break like promise
So casually cruel name bein honest
Im crumpledup piece paper lyin here
Cause I remember all

They say alls well ends well Im new hell
Every time doublecross mind
You said closer age maybe wouldve fine
And made want die
The idea she
A neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects you
Not weepin party bathroom
Some actress askin happened you
Thats happened you
You charmed dad selfeffacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre latenight show
But watched watch front door night willin come
And said Its supposed fun turning twentyone

Time wont fly like Im paralyzed it
Id like old self Im still tryin find it
After plaid shirt days nights made own
Now mail back things I walk home alone
But keep old scarf first week
Cause reminds innocence smells like me
You cant get rid it
Cause remember well yeah

Cause I loved so
Back lost one real thing youve ever known
It rare I there
I remember well
Wind hair there
You remember all
Down stairs there
You remember all
It rare I there

And I never good tellin jokes punch line goes
Ill get older lovers stay age
From Brooklyn broke skin bones
Im soldier whos returning half weight
And twin flame bruise paint blue
Just us love affair maim too
Cause citys barren cold
I still remember first fall snow
And glistened fell
I remember well

Just us love affair maim well

Staying playing back leaving
When birthday passed I didnt call
Then I think summer beautiful times

And realized I loved fall
And cold came dark days
When fear crept mind
You gave love I gave goodbye

Probably mindless dreaming
But loved I swear Id love right

And even moment I knew
You fought hard like army guy
Remember I leaned whispered you

Come baby gonna fly away here
You best four years

I remember drive home
When blind hope turned crying screaming Why
Flowers pile worst way one knows say
About beautiful boy died

And Halloween
You could anything wanted still here
I remember last day I kissed face
And whispered ear

Come baby gonna fly away here
Out curtained room hospital grey well disappear
Come baby gonna fly away here

And I really thought miracle would see us through

And I discovered castles stand
Upon pillars salt pillars sand

For reason I cant explain
Once go never

Shattered windows sound drums
