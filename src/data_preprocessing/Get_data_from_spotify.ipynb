    "Here's an explanation of the features obtained from the Spotify API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Release Date (release_date)**: This represents the date when the track or album was released on Spotify. It can provide information about the historical context of the music and its age.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Popularity (popularity)**: This is a measure of how popular a track is on Spotify. It is based on factors like the number of streams and user engagement. Popularity scores can range from 0 (least popular) to 100 (most popular).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Duration (duration)**: This feature provides the duration of the track in milliseconds. It's the total length of the audio file in terms of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explicit (explicit)**: This binary feature indicates whether a track contains explicit content (e.g., explicit language, themes, or lyrics). It's usually represented as 0 (not explicit) or 1 (explicit).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Danceability (danceability)**: This is a measure of how suitable a track is for dancing based on factors like tempo, rhythm, and beat strength. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating high danceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Energy (energy)**: Energy reflects the intensity and activity level of a track. Higher values indicate more energetic and active music, while lower values suggest calm or subdued music.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Loudness (loudness)**: Loudness is a measure of the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). It can provide insight into how loud or soft a song is.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Modality (modality)**: Modality refers to the musical mode of the track, which can be major or minor. Major keys often convey happiness and positivity, while minor keys are associated with sadder or more intense emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Speechiness (speechiness)**: This feature indicates the presence of spoken words or speech in a track. A higher value suggests the track contains more speech or spoken-word elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Acousticness (acousticness)**: Acousticness measures the amount of acoustic or non-electronic sound in a track. Higher values indicate a more acoustic sound, while lower values indicate a more electronic sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Instrumentalness (instrumentalness)**: Instrumentalness measures the absence of vocals in a track. Higher values suggest that a track is instrumental (i.e., no vocals), while lower values indicate the presence of vocals.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Liveness (liveness)**: Liveness reflects whether a track was recorded in a live concert setting or in a studio. A higher value suggests that the track was recorded live, while a lower value indicates a studio recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Valence (valence)**: Valence is a measure of the positivity or happiness of a track. A higher valence indicates a more positive and happy mood, while a lower valence suggests a more negative or sad mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Tempo (tempo)**: Tempo represents the beats per minute (BPM) of a track. It indicates the speed or pace of the music.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Time Signature (time_signature)**: This feature specifies the time signature of a track, which indicates the number of beats in each measure and the type of note that receives one beat. Common time signatures include 4/4, 3/4, and 6/8, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features provide valuable information about the musical and contextual characteristics of a track, which can be useful for various music-related analyses and recommendations."
